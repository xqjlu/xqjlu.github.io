Most real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) calculations use the length gauge to probe light-matter interactions for non-periodic systems. However, the translational symmetry of the Hamiltonian is broken by the external electric field in this gauge and cannot be used for periodic systems. In this work, we derived and implemented a velocity-gauge real-time time-dependent density functional tight-binding (VG-RT-TDDFTB) formalism for large and long-time scale electron dynamics simulations with periodic boundary conditions. Our approach is highly efficient and parallelizable for electron dynamic simulations of large and complex systems.
