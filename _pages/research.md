In short, I am committed to developing fast and accurate computational theories and methods, which can be used to accurately describe the properties of nanoscale systems.

Velocity-Gauge Real-Time Time-Dependent Tight-Binding (VG-RT-TDDFTB)

Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory (OF-DFT)
======

The accuracy of OF-DFT simulations depends strongly on the quality of the non-interacting kinetic energy and the electron-ion (or electron-pseudocore) interaction energy employed in the simulations. In the past few years, we derived the advanced kinetic energy density functionals. Furthermore, we first proposed the nonlocal pseudopotential method in this field, which defies the belief that nonlocal pseudopotentials are not applicable to OF-DFT, leading to the creation for an alternate theoretical framework of OF-DFT that works superior to the traditional approach.
