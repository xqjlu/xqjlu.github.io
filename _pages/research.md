In short, I am committed to developing fast and accurate computational theories and methods, which can be used to accurately describe the properties of nanoscale systems.

Velocity-Gauge Real-Time DFTB

Orbital-Free DFT
======
* Kinetic Energy Density Funtional (KEDF)
  * Xu-Wang-Ma (XWM) functional for periodic systems. See Ref.[XWM](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.100.205132). 
  * LDAK-X functionals for isolated systems. See Ref.[LDAK-X](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.101.045110).
* Nonlocal Pesudopotential Energy Density Functional (NLPPF). See Ref.[NLPPF](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29002-3).
