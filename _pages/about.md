I am a Postdoc Researcher at [UCR](https://www.ucr.edu/) and affiliate at [LBNL](https://www.lbl.gov). My research focuses on the derivation, development, and implementation of efficient computational methods for condensed matter physics. I am one of the main developers of the VG-RT-TDDFTB, ATLAS and ARES packages for large-scale simulations at the DFT level.

Research Interests
======

My research focuses on the development of novel theoretical and computational method for mesoscale condensed matter physics:

* Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT);
* Velocity-gauge real-time time-dependent density fucntional tight-binding (VG-RT-TDDFTB);
* Real-space pseudopotential electronic structure calculation package (ARES);
* Core-level binding energies calculation method.
