I am a Postdoc Researcher at [UCR](https://www.ucr.edu/) and affliate at at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov).

Email: <qiangx@ucr.edu> / <xuq@lbl.gov>

Research Interests
======

My research focuses on the development of novel theoretical and computational method for mesoscale condensed matter physics:

* Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT);
* Velocity-gauge real-time time-dependent density fucntional tight-binding (VG-rtTDDFTB);
* Real-space pseudopotential electronic structure calculation package;
* Core-level binding energies calculation method.
