I am a Postdoc Researcher at [UC, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/). My research focuses on the derivation, development, and implementation of efficient computational methods for condensed matter physics. I am one of the main developers of the VG-rtTDDFTB, ATLAS and ARES packages for large-scale simulations at the DFT level.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on the development of novel theoretical and computational method for mesoscale condensed matter physics:  
* Orbital-free density functional theory ([OFDFT](https://doi.org/10.1002/wcms.1724));
* Velocity-gauge real-time time-dependent density fucntional tight-binding (VG-rtTDDFTB);
* Real-space pseudopotential electronic structure calculation package (ARES);
* Core-level binding energies calculation method.
