I am a Postdoc Researcher at [UCR](https://www.ucr.edu/) and affiliate at [LBNL](https://www.lbl.gov).

Email: <qiangx@ucr.edu> / <xuq@lbl.gov>

Research Interests
======

My research focuses on the development of novel theoretical and computational method for mesoscale condensed matter physics:

* Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT);
* Velocity-gauge real-time time-dependent density fucntional tight-binding (VG-rtTDDFTB);
* Real-space pseudopotential electronic structure calculation package;
* Core-level binding energies calculation method.

Developed Packages
======

* VG-RT-TDDFTB: Velocity-Gauge Real-Time Time-Dependent Density Fucntional Tight-Binding for large-scale electron dynamics (1000+ atoms).
* ARES : Ab initio Real-Space Electronic Structures calculation method (1-10k atoms).
* ATLAS: Ab initio orbiTaL-free density functionAl theory Software (1-100 million atoms).
