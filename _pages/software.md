* **VG-RT-TDDFTB**: Velocity-Gauge Real-Time Time-Dependent Density Fucntional Tight-Binding
  (Open source in the future)

  We first derived and implemented a new velocity-gauge real-time, time-dependent density functional tight-binding (VG-RT-TDDFTB) method in the open-source DFTB+ software package (https://dftbplus.org) for probing electronic excitations in large, condensed matter systems. Our VG-RT-TDDFTB approach enables real-time electron dynamics simulations of large, periodic, condensed matter systems containing thousands of atoms with a favorable computational scaling as a function of system size. Taken together, our VG-rtTDDFTB approach enables new electron dynamics simulations of complex systems that require large periodic supercells, such as crystal defects, complex surfaces, nanowires, and amorphous materials.
  
* **ARES**: Ab initio Real-Space Electronic Structures software
  (Not open source)

  ARES is a Kohn-Sham DFT based calculation package, utilizing real-space finite-difference method, advanced Chebyshev subspace filtering iteration solver, versatile non-periodic/periodic boundary conditions, and highly parallelizable features making the simulation of large-scale systems possible.

* **ATLAS**: Ab initio orbiTaL-free density functionAl theory Software
  [Downoad](http://atlas-ch.cn/)

  ATLAS is an orbital-free DFT based package for solving the Eulerâ€“Lagrange equation for non-periodic/periodic systems. Due to its quasilinear scaling behaviour, it can be used to simulate mesoscale systems, where contains millions atoms per unit cell.
